NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

␟

Note 1.

␟

Basis of Financial Statement Preparation

␟

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in the context of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Corporation's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Corporation, the information furnished herein reflects all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods reported herein. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

␟

The Corporation's exploration and production activities are accounted for under the "successful efforts" method.

␟

Note 2.

␟

Pioneer Natural Resources Merger

␟

On October 11, 2023, the Corporation entered into a merger agreement with Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer),

␟

an independent oil and gas exploration and production company, in exchange for ExxonMobil common stock. Based on the Octob

␟

er 5 closing price for ExxonMobil shares, the fixed exchange rate of

␟

per Pioneer share, and Pioneer's outstanding net debt, the implied enterprise value of the transaction was approximately $

␟

Pioneer holds over

␟

net acres in the Midland Basin of West Texas, which consist of proved reserves totaling over

␟

Note 3.

␟

Litigation and Other Contingencies

␟

Litigation

␟

A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies.

␟

State and local governments and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States and its territories have filed a number of legal proceedings against several oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting unprecedented legal and equitable relief for various alleged injuries purportedly connected to climate change. These lawsuits assert a variety of novel, untested claims under statutory and common law. Additional such lawsuits may be filed. We believe the legal and factual theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless and represent an inappropriate attempt to use the court system to usurp the proper role of policymakers in addressing the societal challenges of climate change.

␟

Local governments in Louisiana have filed unprecedented legal proceedings against a number of oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting compensation for the restoration of coastal marsh erosion in the state. We believe the factual and legal theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

␟

Overview

␟

In the first quarter of 2024 the price of crude oil remained flat relative to fourth quarter 2023 and near the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year range (2010-2019), as markets remained balanced. More recently, the market for crude has tightened driven by ongoing concerns over conflict in the Middle East. Natural gas prices decreased, moving back toward the middle of the 10-year range, on high inventory levels and lower demand. Refining margins in the quarter rose to the top of the 10-year range, as demand grew while turnarounds and global disruptions weighed on supply. Chemical margins remained relatively flat at bottom-of-cycle conditions, as new capacity additions offset demand growth.

␟

Recent Mergers and Acquisitions

␟

In October 2023, ExxonMobil announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Pioneer Natural Resources. The transaction represents an opportunity to deliver leading capital efficiency and cost performance as well as increase production by combining Pioneer's large scale, contiguous, high-quality undeveloped Midland acreage with ExxonMobil's Permian resource development approach. In addition to increasing production, we plan to pull forward Pioneer's Net Zero ambition by 15 years, from 2050 to 2035. See "Note 2. Pioneer Natural Resources Merger" of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The company evaluates these factors periodically to determine if any enhancements may provide helpful insights to the market.  Listed below are descriptions of the earnings factors:

␟

Advantaged Volume Growth.

␟

Earnings impacts from change in volume/mix from advantaged assets, strategic projects, and high-value products.

␟

Advantaged Assets (Advantaged growth projects).

␟

Includes Permian, Guyana, Brazil, and LNG.

␟

Strategic Projects.

␟

Includes (i) the following completed projects: Rotterdam Hydrocracker, Corpus Christi Chemical Complex, Baton Rouge Polypropylene, Beaumont Crude Expansion, Baytown Chemical Expansion, Permian Crude Venture, and the 2022 Baytown advanced recycling facility; and (ii) the following projects still to be completed: Fawley Hydrofiner, China Chemical Complex, Singapore Resid Upgrade, Strathcona Renewable Diesel, Proxxima Venture

␟

TM

␟

, USGC Reconfiguration, additional advanced recycling projects under evaluation worldwide, and additional projects in plan yet to be publicly announced.

␟

High-Value Products.

␟

Includes performance products and lower-emission fuels. Performance products (performance chemicals, performance lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end-users.

␟

Lower-emission fuels refers to fuels with lower life cycle emissions than conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.

␟

Base Volume.

␟

Includes all volume/mix factors not included in Advantaged Volume Growth defined above.

␟

Structural Cost Savings.

␟

After-tax earnings effect of Structural Cost Savings as defined on page 19, including cash operating expenses related to divestments that were previously in the "volume/mix" factor.

␟

Expenses.

␟

Includes all expenses otherwise not included in other earnings factors.

␟

Timing Effects.

␟

Timing effects are primarily related to unsettled derivatives (mark-to-market) and other earnings impacts driven by timing differences between the settlement of derivatives and their offsetting physical commodity realizations (due to LIFO inventory accounting).

␟

Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items

␟

Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (non-GAAP) are earnings (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter. The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item for an individual segment in a given quarter may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several periods or several segments. Earnings (loss) excluding identified items does include non-operational earnings events or impacts that are generally below the $250 million threshold utilized for Identified Items. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items is not meant to be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

␟

Structural Cost Savings

␟

Structural Cost Savings describes decreases in cash opex excluding energy and production taxes as a result of operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, divestment-related reductions, and other cost-savings measures that are expected to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Relative to 2019, estimated cumulative Structural Cost Savings totaled $10.1 billion, which included an additional $0.4 billion in the first three months of 2024. The total change between periods in expenses below will reflect both Structural Cost Savings and other changes in spend, including market factors, such as inflation and foreign exchange impacts, as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated with new operations. Estimates of cumulative annual structural savings may be revised depending on whether cost reductions realized in prior periods are determined to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Structural Cost Savings are stewarded internally to support management's oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors to understand the Corporation's efforts to optimize spending through disciplined expense management.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

␟

Statements related to future events; projections; descriptions of strategic, operating, and financial plans and objectives; statements of future ambitions and plans; and other statements of future events or conditions, are forward-looking statements. Similarly, discussion of roadmaps or future plans related to carbon capture, transportation and storage, biofuel, hydrogen, direct air capture, and other future plans to reduce emissions and emission intensity of ExxonMobil, its affiliates, companies it is seeking to acquire and third parties are dependent on future market factors, such as continued technological progress, policy support and timely rule-making and permitting, and represent forward-looking statements.

␟

Forward-looking and other statements regarding environmental and other sustainability efforts and aspirations are not an indication that these statements are material to investors or require disclosure in our filing with the SEC. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking environmental and other sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future, including future rule-making.
